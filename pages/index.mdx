## About

I am [Janani](https://vercel.com/jramanar/portfolio1). I work as a Technical Solutions Engineer-II at [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/). I have always been passionate about technology and particularly CDN technology. I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science and a curious mind to learn more.I have been in the industry for about 4.5 years now. I enjoy learning how to code, troubleshoot the errors and work in resolving customer issues.

 ## Tasks
 
 Favourite tasks:
 1. Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project
 2. Write and maintain support articles and docs pages
 3. Manage a support team
 4. Act as a dedicated CSE for a handful of key customers to ensure their success using Vercel
 5. Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers
 6. Work with engineering teams during incidents and provide updates to internal and external stakeholders

<p> 
As a customer success Engineer, I love to troubleshoot on variety of issues seen and go through logs to understand the reason for the error. Once the issue is resolved, it needs to be documented so that if any such issue araises again, the issue can be resolved quickly. This saves the customer's time and the engineer's effort.Having dedicated accounts for an engineer, creates a relation between the engineer and the customer and they understand eachother's wave length. This helps in building a good relationship professionally and also helps the engineer understand the configs better to troubleshoot the issues faster.Working in a support team from the start has given me some insights on the best practices that can be applied to manage and work with the team to deliver the best results in shorter time.
Feedbacks from customers help us understand the requirement behind the ask. This helps us improve our portal and make the customer's life easier. Working with the product team will helps in understanding the basic requirements and will also help us understand the backend calls made. This will improve the knowledge on the product and will also help build internal relations with other teams. 

 
Not-so Favourite:

1. Respond to 50+ support requests via email every day
2. Help resolve billing issues for customers
3. Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case
4. Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use
5. Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and other 3rd party sites
  
Depending on the request presented by the customer, the answer depends for "Respond to 50+ support requests via email every day".I have never worked on billing  and new things make me really cautious. Learning more will help me get billing topics as well into my favourite zone.I prefer reading an article and understanding than watching a video because videos are really long and the brain zones out in sometime if the video is not interactive.I would prefer having a document where in one can add the type of issue seen to create the trend of issues seen than analysing the support tickets. I understand that it might be cumbersome.One more alternative that I can think of is to have an app, that will search for the keywords entered and segregate the cases. Based on the case description provided by the engineer(this will have more details than the customer issue provided), a trend can be spotted easily.
Since I am still new to Vercel, responding to queries in 3rd party sites is not my cup of tea. Once I learn the knack of working on cases, I should be able to take up the task easily.

 ***My concept is never dislike something cause it creates an impression in the mind and you will not learn it. Everything can be learnt with hardwork and effort.***

 

## Learn
 
 I would love to learn more coding and improve my technical knowledge and grow to become a successful leader.
 Short-term goal: Become more versatile with the technical products to grow technically
 Long-term goal: Get into a technical+managerial role.
 
 ## Technical Article

"Loyalty for Sale"(Retail and Hospitality Fraud) : During the pandemic, the retail,travel and hospitality industries were deeply affected.These industries protects the personal datas like name,address,phone number etc. As the world came to stand-still, criminals ceased the moment and targetted these sectors with attacks using SQL local file inclusion attacks.There were 4 billion web attacks reported accounting for 41% increase in overall attack volume.
This article provides the different types of attacks that werre performed and the steps taken to mitigate it.

Link for reference: https://www.akamai.com/content/dam/site/en/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-security-loyalty-for-sale-retail-and-hospitality-fraud-report-2020.pdf

This article created a positive impact on me and made me understand the importance of safety of big data with help of cyber security.I further enhanced my learning on cyber security by doing a certificate and was awarded "Certified Information Assurance Professional" from DIAT(Defence Institute of Advance Technology,Pune) 
 
 ## Redirect
I have created a link for in-app redirect.
https://portfolio1-jramanar.vercel.app/view-vercel gets redirected to the Vercel home page. 
 
 ## Redirect Assist
 I understand that you want to redirect a path(/hello-vercel) to https://vercel.com. The Vercel platform supports both 301 permanent redirects and 308 permanent redirects. Both permanent redirects are supported for domain redirects and in-application paths.
 
Example of how to set the redirect:

```
{
  "redirects": [
    { 
      "source": "/hello-vercel",
      "destination": "https://vercel.com", 
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Please let me know if you have any queries/concerns. I will be glad to assist you.

## GoDaddy Domain

Custom domains can be set at Vercel. To add a custom domain to your project, navigate to the Domains section under the Settings tab for the project, enter the URL for your custom domain and click "Add".It is possible to add both apex and subdomains to a project up to a limit of 50 dependent on your account plan.
Once you have added your custom domain, you will need to verify the domain so that it can be used with your Vercel Project. The dashboard will automatically provide further instructions required for verifying your domain.

Dependent on the type of domain added, either apex or subdomain, you will be presented with differing options for verifying it. Apex domains can be verified by adding an A record with your existing DNS provider whilst subdomains can be verified by adding a CNAME record.

2. https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-do-i-add-a-custom-domain-to-my-vercel-project


## Common Issues 

The common issues seen would be deployment of sites and site performance.The deployment is quicker and user-friendly and the starter packs in Vercel products helps developers use the existing code and build on that.So they don't need to do it from scratch.

## Enhancement

This is the first take-at-home test that I have taken that is more of understanding the platform than answering emails to issues provided in the questionnare. 
This test has made me feel more comfortable with the Vercel portal and I donot have any recommendations on how to improve this at the moment.
